\maketitle

\begin{abstract}  
  In this paper, we introduce AgentSpeak(ER), an extension of the
  AgentSpeak(L) language tailored to support encapsulation. The
  AgentSpeak(ER) extension allows for significantly improving the
  style of BDI agent programming along relevant aspects, including
  program modularity and readability, failure handling, and reactive
  as well as goal-based reasoning. The paper introduces the novel
  language based on AgentSpeak, %, formalises the changes in the usual semantics of AgentSpeak, 
  illustrates the features of the language through
  examples, and shows results of experiments evaluating the proposed
  language.
